#+title: canonical term


The best term for something basically.

I'll use this page as a "tag page" like:

#+begin_quote
I like the sausage burritos with mustard that are popular in America (not sure sausage burrito is the canonical term here)
#+end_quote

Then I'll occasionally look at backlinks here and say I saw the above and realized what the canonical term was:

#+begin_src diff
I like the hot dogs with mustard that are popular in America)
#+end_src
