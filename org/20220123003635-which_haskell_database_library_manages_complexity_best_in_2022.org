#+title: Which Haskell database library manages complexity best in 2022?


#+begin_quote
Now that I've used Esqueleto professionally in anger, I would understand anyone who used it and then swore off static types forever. - @ttuegel
#+end_quote

Seeing this quote got me thinking about writing this very node again since I:

- frequently use Esqueleto
- have used Beam in the past
- have looked on longingly at rel8 (built on top of Opaleye)
- Recently annoyed with complexity while trying to teach others to use soon to be default Esqueleto.Experimental

I had the thought on a mentally slow day where I was struggling to line up types that Esqueleto.Experimental didn't seem much easier than Beam did and wondered if it could be more complex.

This is my exploration to see if using a complex (rather than simple) example if Esqueleto.Experimental is still the simplest.

* Real-world example with some complexity

* Esqueleto

* Beam

* rel8
