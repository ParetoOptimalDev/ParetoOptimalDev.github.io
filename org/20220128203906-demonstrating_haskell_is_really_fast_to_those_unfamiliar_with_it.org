#+title: Demonstrating Haskell is really fast to those unfamiliar with it

* Motivation

I've had this idea before, but actually creating this page was inspired by a tweet:

#+begin_quote
Does anybody have in mind a good way how to show people not familiar with Haskell that it's really fast?

Probably something other than this https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/haskell.html

Maybe anyone has real experience of migrating the project from JVM to Haskell or something similar?
#+end_quote

This also brings to mind [[id:6b9eafcb-6697-49f2-bc46-2295c3b76409][How to make Haskell the programming industry default]] (that's a tall order!)
 
* easy parallel downloading

One common task across programming languages is downloading things in parallel and Haskell makes this very easy to do fast.

Untype checked Haskell warning:

#+begin_src haskell
import Network.HTTP
siteResponses <- simpleHTTP (getRequest "http://www.haskell.org/") <*> simpleHTTP (getRequest "http://www.twitter.com/") <*> simpleHTTP (getRequest "http://www.twitter.com/")
let getFirst100BytesFromResponse rsp = fmap (take 100) (getResponseBody rsp)
fmap getFirst100BytesFromResponse siteResponses
#+end_src
