#+title: Finding the best style of literate emacs configuration

* The typical per-package use-package literate style

Typically use-package is the first and only way of organizing emacs configurations most emacsers are exposed to.

It's natural that most kiterate configs would faithfully represent that organizational structure, but with the added benefit if collaosi ke nodes and perhaps notes on the entire use package block.

* Per use-case literate style

Once your configuration starts getting really large, the use-package style can start losing meaning and feel very overwhelming.

A solution is to organize by use case and use =noweb-ref= in case ordering matters to tangle the blocks organized by use case into use package blocks. Here's a
