* In general, I was searching for [[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22literate+programming+in+the+large][literate programming in the large]] after watching [[id:e77a19c0-d2c9-4f12-98f8-41d92233f7d6][Literature: Literate Programming in the Large - Timothy Daly]]
** [[id:3fb11cd7-0b46-4a1c-bba8-dfd84bfc0c59][Literature: A New Way to Organize Programs - akkartik.name]]
** [[id:6610d224-6f8b-48ef-9d47-4fd2d9b57ee6][Literature: Literate programming: presenting code in human order]]
* Also thinking about [[id:4cf7ba2e-e038-424d-bb78-51381cdeb2e2][worse is better]] and had some links there, but perhaps I'll add them tomorrow
* general programming related
** [[id:a5d05975-96b9-4bd5-aaa5-4dbe7bb776ff][Literature: The trouble with 'readability' - akkartik.name]]
* A cool test of [[id:e77a19c0-d2c9-4f12-98f8-41d92233f7d6][Literature: Literate Programming in the Large - Timothy Daly]] would be to rewrite Haskell's Pandoc as a literate program ([[id:70eccb0d-a16f-4e2a-ac1f-327350277572][cool project idea]])
* [[id:f664e095-d175-4f5c-a3cd-d86fc7049726][Literature: Habitability and Piecemeal Growth - akkartik.name]]
* Oh, I should rewrite this blog into a literate program ([[id:70eccb0d-a16f-4e2a-ac1f-327350277572][cool project idea]])
* Commento comments not working in stacked frame pages :/
