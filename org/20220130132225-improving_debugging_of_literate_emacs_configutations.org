#+title: Improving debugging of literate emacs configutations

Two things are required:

- [[id:750cea12-ecc1-4f0c-b96c-481275712ca1][Automatically rolling back to a working emacs configuration on configuration error]]
- [[id:0234e238-1f58-4646-8b14-0538edf1024f][Syncing changes from an org-babel tangled file back to the literate file]]

Then you effectively eliminate most of the extra friction of literate configurations by having both literate/unliterate as an option without the extra copying work.
