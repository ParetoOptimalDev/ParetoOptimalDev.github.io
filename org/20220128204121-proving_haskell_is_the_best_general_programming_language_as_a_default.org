#+title: Proving Haskell is the best general programming language as a default


This one will be tough, because the common retort will be best for what.

For now I'll respond by asking if you had a language in mind when I mentioned "most generally applicable programming language".

I bet it with something along the lines of:

- Java
- C#
- Python
- Rust

So there is a shared definition amongst us there somewhere, but some work will have to be done to flesh that out.
