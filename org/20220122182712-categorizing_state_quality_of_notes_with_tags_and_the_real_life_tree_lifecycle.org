#+title: Categorizing state/quality of notes with tags and the real life tree lifecycle

It can be useful to look at the "timelines", "maturity of development", or "doneness" of notes in an exobrain, zettlekasten, or digital garden given quality can vary widely.

Taking inspiration from [[id:9a2b5d98-d007-4505-b736-591e5b5ec2c8][Evergreen Notes]] we can use the following tree inspired cateories:

- seed (aka stub elsewhere)
- stem
- sprout
- sapling
- tree
- evergreen

This could be further augmented by using tags to delineate between =polished= and =unpolished= pieces of writing.

One example is an =unpolished= =evergreen= would have strong concepts and a well formed idea but the structure could be very messy or a little hard to follow.
