#+title: installing NixOS using devos and nix flakes

* Create a live usb with the latest [[id:4d24c424-8b8b-4f35-97eb-ed8eee51f8ec][NixOS]] 21.11

** [[https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-21.11/latest-nixos-gnome-x86_64-linux.iso][Download the recommended gnome version]]

** Follow instructions for [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-booting-from-usb][Copying it to a usb stick]] but with a progress bar and larger block size

So that means:

#+name: WNgMyABrpQ6QxnjpqdqoRi
#+begin_src sh
dd if=path-to-image of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 status=progress
#+end_src

** go for a short walk

** run the =sync= command to flush caches because I'm paranoid

* Boot into the live cd with no issues

Wow Linux setup has come a long way!

* open a terminal as root

* Clone my devos fork

#+name: ZQHmabsDDmQP5xiG6BwYmJ
#+begin_src sh
git clone git@github.com:ParetoOptimalDev/system.git
#+end_src

* Enter =system= and run =nix-shell=

* Do a 5m yoga session

* Partition for dual booting windows

Roughly you can follow https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-partitioning

** In gparted

*** resize the windows partition to make room for the =nixos= and =swap= partitions and label them

*** I'll re-use the already created boot partition

That means I'll mount it differently from the instructions later

** wait a bit, surprisingly this completed in just a couple minutes

* Mount partitions

** Roughly follow https://devos.divnix.com/start/bootstrapping.html#mount-partitions with some differences

#+name: mv5k8iNKCzY4s6UveZbFeG
#+begin_src sh
mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt
#+end_src

one difference being the already created EFI =boot= partition was named =SYSTEM=

#+name: ScozYCiZaySkjF6ufiVdMJ
#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p /mnt/boot && mount /dev/disk/by-label/SYSTEM /mnt/boot
#+end_src

#+name: HawSNMxRyXRAbdDBsiVvRU
#+begin_src sh
swapon /dev/disk/by-label/swap
#+end_src

#+name: gcUvLym3gWWb9VUxw2RxYt
#+begin_src sh
  mkdir -p /mnt/tmpstore/{work,store}
mount -t overlay overlay -olowerdir=/nix/store,upperdir=/mnt/tmpstore/store,workdir=/mnt/tmpstore/work /nix/store
#+end_src

* [[*Do the hardware configuration correctly][Do the hardware configuration correctly unlike me the first time]]

* Start installing from flake

#+name: n6AxfuoaTsa475Uap6eCSh
#+begin_src sh
nixos-install --flake .#NixOS
#+end_src

* Go watch a tv show

* type in a root password

* reboot and pull out live usb

* Do the hardware configuration correctly

** I had to do this but luckily you can do it right the first time

*** select nixos, it hangs on =waiting for /dev/disk/by-id/nixos= to appear :S

*** put live usb back in, hit r to reboot, hit F12 to select usb drive as boot device

*** figure out what's wrong

*** for some reason it's not finding nixos by label

*** we'll generate a custom hardware configuration

** run =bud up=

*** verify these records look okay in =hosts/NixOS/hardware-configuration.nix=


Something like:

#+begin_src nix
  fileSystems."/" =
    { device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/your-linux-partition-uuid";
      fsType = "ext4";
    };

  fileSystems."/boot" =
    { device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/your-boot-partition-uuid";
      fsType = "vfat";
    };
#+end_src

*** now you're ready to install and hopefully boot successfully in the next step

** I actually think this isn't supposed to be necessary

The default NixOS host has:

#+begin_src nix
  fileSystems."/" = { device = "/dev/disk/by-label/nixos"; };
#+end_src

but IIRC my error said something like:

Couldn't find =/dev/disk/by-id/nixos=

So maybe there's a boot loader generation bug where =label= should be used rather than =id=

I'll tag it with [[id:738c41e1-7312-4125-94a7-ce5489df77b7][issues with DevOS]] for now and maybe post an upstream issue later.
