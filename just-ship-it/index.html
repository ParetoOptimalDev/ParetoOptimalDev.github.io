Of course, even those technical decision makers are beholden to even higher ups and various perverse organizational incentives. Even still, my experience has shown they usually have significant leeway to affect technological quality and culture that surrounds the context of why I talk of Pareto Optimality and software development together.\nSo what is Pareto Optimality? What is it? So uhh\u0026hellip; yeah\u0026hellip; what exactly was Pareto Optimality again? Drawing from the original quote that got me thinking about pareto optimality and software development we get the quote:\n in short, Pareto-optimal means that if you are optimizing between two quantities, you can not increase one without decreasing the other. You can draw a boundary between \u0026ldquo;all of X, none of Y\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;none of X, all of Y\u0026rdquo; that has certain characteristics\u0026hellip;\n And then making things a little more concrete and tying into how not considering Pareto Optimality is a major cognitive biases in software development:\n \u0026hellip; one very common cognitive mistake people in general make is to speak of a \u0026ldquo;tradeoff\u0026rdquo; between X and Y without taking the time to first establish that they are Pareto optimal, because if you\u0026rsquo;re not yet Pareto optimal, that mean that you can in fact have more of X without having less of Y yet, and constraining the discussion to \u0026ldquo;tradeoffs\u0026rdquo; is introducing a false premise.\n Security vs Convenience phone lockscreen example And as an example for \u0026ldquo;security vs convenience\u0026rdquo; you could imagine:\n I have a pattern on my phone lockscreen for good security with low cost to convenience I have an 8 digit pin on my phone lockscreen for better security at a higher cost of convenience I have neither a pin nor pattern on my lockscreen for convenience  Then with that context, reflect upon this quote:\n A real world example is \u0026ldquo;security vs. convenience\u0026rdquo;; the vast bulk of real-world situations in which we putatively have this conversation, we could in fact have more of either without affecting the other, because we should be so lucky as to be on the Pareto optimality line.\n Bob likes convienence, not Pareto Optimality With just the phone lockscreen example, we can\u0026rsquo;t quite give a good example. Let\u0026rsquo;s broaden to phone security and construct a dialogue between two people talking about phone security:\nJill: Bob, you should enable automatic updates for better security. Bob: I prefer convenience to security, that\u0026rsquo;s why I neither have a lock screen nor have automatic updates enabled.\nHere Bob has ignored Pareto Optimality for the context of phone security and convenience because he could enable automatic updates at no (well little) cost to convenience and keep using his phone without a lockscreen.\nOr filling in X and Y from the earlier quote:\n common cognitive mistake people in general make is to speak of a \u0026ldquo;tradeoff\u0026rdquo; between X and Y without taking the time to first establish that they are Pareto optimal, because if you\u0026rsquo;re not yet Pareto optimal, that mean that you can in fact have more of X without having less of Y yet, and constraining the discussion to \u0026ldquo;tradeoffs\u0026rdquo; is introducing a false premise.\n we get:\n common cognitive mistake people in general make is to speak of a \u0026ldquo;tradeoff\u0026rdquo; between Security and Convenience without taking the time to first establish that they are Pareto optimal, because if you\u0026rsquo;re not yet Pareto optimal, that means that you can in fact have more of Security without having less of Convenience yet, and constraining the discussion to \u0026ldquo;tradeoffs\u0026rdquo; is introducing a false premise.\n Meta: A less contrived example would be awesome!    critics of Pareto Optimality and software development and/or advocates of worse is better might argue any example would be contrived\n  to try and counteract my cognitive biases by playing devils advocate    By analogy: Not considering Pareto Optimality is \u0026ldquo;just settling for worse\u0026rdquo; ",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/pareto-optimality-and-software-development/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/personal-knowledge-management\/":{title:"Personal Knowledge Management",tags:[],content:"",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/personal-knowledge-management/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/posts\/":{title:"Posts",tags:[],content:"",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/posts/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/prefer-macro-level-simplicity-even-if-it-means-micro-level-complexity\/":{title:"Prefer macro-level simplicity even if it means micro-level complexity",tags:["seed"],content:"Related Haskell ",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/prefer-macro-level-simplicity-even-if-it-means-micro-level-complexity/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/principle-of-charity\/":{title:"Principle of Charity",tags:[],content:"",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/principle-of-charity/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/replacing-straight.el-with-nix-to-manage-emacs-packages\/":{title:"Replacing straight.el with Nix to manage emacs packages",tags:[],content:"Why?

I also value simplicity in the large over simplicity in the small, but practices such as agile software development make it hard to consider simplicity in the large given they try to eliminate big design up front.\nThat results in higher adoption of database driven design over domain driven design which I consider to be at least suboptimal. I\u0026rsquo;m of the opinion that database driven design is inferior to domain driven design most of the time, and since \u0026ldquo;simple haskell\u0026rdquo; moves the needle towards the same brand of simplicity underpinning worse is better and the aforementioned database driven design I find myself rejecting it\u0026rsquo;s tenets as well.\nHowever\u0026hellip; I care about teachability of programming languages and reducing unnecessary complexity and I think that \u0026ldquo;simple haskell\u0026rdquo; has merits in this area.\nThis is complicated by the question of whether a programming language that is easy to learn is a virtue or not.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll try and avoid the myraid of ethical questions surrounding that statement since this for now I\u0026rsquo;m keeping this exobrain narrowly technologically focused.\nMaybe \u0026ldquo;fancy Haskell\u0026rdquo; is like getting a 4 year degree and worth it even though it\u0026rsquo;s harder at first.\nAnother part of \u0026ldquo;simple haskell\u0026rdquo; seems to be to prefer monomorphic functions to polymorphic functions, but I feel that\u0026rsquo;s just a way to avoid big design up front either by choice, inertia, or lack of familiarity. is complexity determined mostly by familiarity?\n",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/simple-haskell/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/tags\/":{title:"Tags",tags:[],content:"",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/tags/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/the-original-quote-that-got-me-thinking-about-pareto-optimality-and-software-development\/":{title:"the original quote that got me thinking about pareto optimality and software development",tags:[],content:"quote  One could make a case that what we\u0026rsquo;re seeing here is that Haskell web frameworks, and probably a great deal more of the real Haskell code the community has produced in the past few years, is reaching the Pareto optimality frontier between ease-of-use and type safety guarantees.\nI imagine a lot of people know what that is given where I am :), but in short, Pareto-optimal means that if you are optimizing between two quantities, you can not increase one without decreasing the other. You can draw a boundary between \u0026ldquo;all of X, none of Y\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;none of X, all of Y\u0026rdquo; that has certain characteristics which you can read about elsewhere if you are interested.\nI bring this up because one very common cognitive mistake people in general make is to speak of a \u0026ldquo;tradeoff\u0026rdquo; between X and Y without taking the time to first establish that they are Pareto optimal, because if you\u0026rsquo;re not yet Pareto optimal, that mean that you can in fact have more of X without having less of Y yet, and constraining the discussion to \u0026ldquo;tradeoffs\u0026rdquo; is introducing a false premise. A real world example is \u0026ldquo;security vs. convenience\u0026rdquo;; the vast bulk of real-world situations in which we putatively have this conversation, we could in fact have more of either without affecting the other, because we should be so lucky as to be on the Pareto optimality line.\nThe less-common second-order mistake is that when a particular X and Y have spent a very long time nowhere near the optimality frontier, people can forget that there is, in fact, a tradeoff to be had, if you do manage to optimize sufficiently. As a third-order consequence, it becomes easy to adopt an X-at-all-costs metric because if you never have to pay in Y, more X is always a good thing.\nArguably, ease-of-use and type safety could be such a case. For a long time the Haskell community has had a lot of places to get \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; gains in both dimensions. But, it should be expected that if you get enough of these gains squared away, that eventually you will hit the point where they will become tradeoffs.

Users with differing skills and needs may choose different points on the curve for their own needs, but a discussion about tradeoffs is a fundamentally different discussion than one about right vs. wrong.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just musing and providing food for thought. Whether Haskell is there yet anywhere is an interesting question. But if it is, I\u0026rsquo;d have to say that while in some ways it may be the sad passing of an era, it is also an incredible accomplishment, because I don\u0026rsquo;t think any other language community has ever even gotten close to the optimality frontier while retaining a high degree of type-based safety.\n(I could probably make a case for some languages with low type-based safety and high ease of use, though if you start poking at it \u0026ldquo;ease of use\u0026rdquo; is a family of criteria rather than a unique one; for instance, \u0026ldquo;easy 10 line script\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;easy million-line system\u0026rdquo; are substantially different languages.)\n https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/3qtmgt/beginner%5Ffriendly%5Fcode%5Fand%5Fapis/cwida8e/\nTODO sentence by sentence analysis/commentary ",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/the-original-quote-that-got-me-thinking-about-pareto-optimality-and-software-development/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/vscode\/":{title:"vscode",tags:[],content:"",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/vscode/"},"https:\/\/paretooptimaldev.github.io\/worse-is-better\/":{title:"worse is better",tags:[],content:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse%5Fis%5Fbetter\nAlso known as \u0026ldquo;New Jersey style\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Rise of ``Worse is Better''\nRelated Go Simple Haskell ",url:"https://paretooptimaldev.github.io/worse-is-better/"}}</script>
