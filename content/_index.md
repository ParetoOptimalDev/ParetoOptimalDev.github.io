# How to use this exobrain

Hi! I'm ParetoOptimalDev, or as twitter resorts to calling me [@ParetoOptimal_](https://twitter.com/ParetoOptimal_). Feel free to follow there if you want to see me look for people wrong on the internet :)

Now about this mish-mash of stubs (seeds), articles, half-baked ideas, and hopefully soon golden nuggets of information:

- Don't expect blog post quality or polish, the idea is to represent thoughts and ideas to grow them over time (expect [quality labeling](./categorizing-state/quality/-maturity-of-notes-with-tags-and-the-real-life-tree-lifecycle/) in the future though)
- How to find content
  - Pick one of [listed topics](#topics-at-the-front-of-my-mind) and go exploring!
  - Browse through the full list of posts
  - Search for terms of interest
