# How to use this exobrain

- Don't expect blog post quality or polish, the idea is to represent thoughts and ideas to grow them over time (expect [quality labeling](./Categorizing-state-quality-of-notes-with-tags-and-the-real-life-tree-lifecycle) in the future though)
- How to find content
  - Pick one of [listed topics](#topics-at-the-front-of-my-mind) and go exploring!
  - Browse through the full list of posts
  - Search for terms of interest
  
# Pareto Optimal? Huh?

# Topics at the front of my mind

- [Haskell](./haskell/)
